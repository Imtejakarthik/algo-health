# Health Data AI - README

## Overview
Health Data AI is an advanced Python-based AI system designed to analyze health trends in India. It processes synthetic health data to identify prevalent health issues and generate recommendations for preventive and corrective measures. Additionally, the system provides visual representations of the health landscape using five different plots.

## Features
- **Health Data Analysis:** Generates and processes synthetic health-related cases across different medical categories.
- **Trend Identification:** Analyzes health issue prevalence and trends over time.
- **Automated Recommendations:** Provides suggestions for mitigating health risks based on detected patterns.
- **Data Visualization:** Generates multiple plots to display health trends effectively.

## Data Categories
The AI system categorizes health cases into:
- **Cardiovascular**
- **Diabetes**
- **Respiratory**
- **Mental Health**
- **Obesity**
- **General Wellness**

## Generated Plots
The system visualizes data using:
1. **Pie Chart:** Displays the distribution of health issues by category.
2. **Bar Chart:** Illustrates total cases per health category.
3. **Line Chart:** Shows health case trends over a six-month period.
4. **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Compares preventive measures vs. medical treatments.
5. **Regional Comparison Chart:** Highlights variations in health issues across different regions of India.

## Installation and Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script to analyze health trends and generate visual insights:
```bash
python health_data_ai.py
```

## Output
- Printed recommendations for mitigating health risks.
- Five different plots providing insights into India's health trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time health data.
- More granular regional insights.
- Machine learning models for predictive health analytics.
